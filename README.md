# NoSQL-SocialNetworkAPI

## User Story 

As a developer
I WANT a Social Network API that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Description

Once I enter the command to start the application my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.
I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
I can test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
and I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.
When I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
I also am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list

## Usage
- npm install
- npm i express
- npm i mongoose
