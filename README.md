As a developer
I WANT a Social Network API that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

and I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.
When I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
I also am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
